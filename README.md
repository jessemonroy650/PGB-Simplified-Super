# PGB-Simplified-Super
A Simple App that updates one page app with an image and text.

This is a two (2) page app. One (1) page for the HTML and CSS. One (1) page for the Javascript - save the two line in the HTML that start the app.

When the app starts, it shows a four (4) bell peppers with a black background.
Once the DOM of the app loads, it switches to a single yellow bell pepper.
Once the Cordova/Phonegap "deviceready" event fires, the image changes to an apple - not a banana.

In addition, some text below the image says "it no worky".
Once the DOM of the app loads, the text changes to "app.onDOMContentLoaded".
Once the Cordova/Phonegap "deviceready" event fires,  the text changes to "app.onDeviceReady".
